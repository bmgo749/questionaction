# WikiInfo Application

## Overview

WikiInfo is a modern web application that serves as a comprehensive knowledge platform across multiple disciplines and languages. The application features a clean, responsive design with support for multiple languages (English, Indonesian, Malay) and both light and dark themes. Built with a modern tech stack, it provides users with categorized access to information similar to Wikipedia but with a more streamlined interface.

## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Context for theme and language management, TanStack Query for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development
- **Production**: esbuild for bundling server code

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via DATABASE_URL)
- **Schema Management**: Centralized schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Drizzle-kit for database migrations

### UI Components
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Theme**: Custom CSS variables for consistent theming
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography

### Internationalization
- **Languages**: English (en), Indonesian (id), Malay (my)
- **Implementation**: Context-based translation system with localStorage persistence
- **Structure**: Nested translation keys for organized content management

### Category System
The application organizes content into 10 main categories:
- World (global affairs, international relations)
- History (historical events, civilizations)
- Science (scientific discoveries, research)
- Geography (countries, cities, natural features)
- Sports (sports history, athletes, competitions)
- Entertainment (movies, music, celebrities)
- Politics (political systems, elections, governance)
- Technology (computing, innovation, digital trends)
- Health (medical advances, wellness, healthcare)
- Education (learning systems, academic institutions)

## Data Flow

### Client-Server Communication
1. **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints under `/api/` prefix
2. **Request Handling**: Express middleware for JSON parsing and logging
3. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with status codes
4. **Development**: Vite dev server proxy for seamless development experience

### State Management
1. **Client State**: React Context for UI state (theme, language)
2. **Server State**: TanStack Query for caching and synchronization
3. **Local Storage**: Persistence for user preferences (theme, language)

### Frontend Routing
- Home page (`/`) - Main dashboard with category overview
- Category pages (`/category/:slug`) - Category-specific content
- 404 handling for unknown routes

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, React DOM, React Router (Wouter)
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, @neondatabase/serverless for PostgreSQL
- **Development**: Vite, TypeScript, esbuild for production builds

### Development Tools
- **Linting/Formatting**: TypeScript compiler for type checking
- **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend bundling
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server with HMR support

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR on client port
- **Backend**: tsx execution of TypeScript server code
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via environment variable configuration
- **Assets**: Served through Vite's asset handling

### Production Build
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized React application to `dist/public`
2. **Backend**: esbuild bundles TypeScript server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Static Assets**: Frontend build output served by Express in production
4. **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: NODE_ENV=development with tsx and Vite
- **Production**: NODE_ENV=production with built assets
- **Database**: Configurable via DATABASE_URL environment variable

The architecture prioritizes developer experience with hot reload, type safety, and modern tooling while maintaining production readiness with optimized builds and proper error handling.
